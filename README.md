The fashion-mnist dataset was chosen specifically for its prevalence as a benchmark in recent research into neural networks. Its size, labels, and compatibility (with the long-established MNIST dataset) make
it an ideal choice for evaluating deep neural networks and
GANs.

The primary objective of this research is to classify and generate images of clothing items. It is a compilation of three distinct efforts: <br/>
(1) to classify fashion-mnist images and, inversely, add adversarial noise to test the classifier <br/>
(2) to generate novel images which emulate the true fashion-mnist images; <br/>
(3) to infuse the grayscale images with life-like colors.
